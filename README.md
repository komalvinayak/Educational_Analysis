## 👩‍💻 Project Title:
**Educational Apps Analysis - A Python Project**

## 🎯 Objective:
To explore, clean, analyze, and visualize data of various educational apps to identify the most efficient and popular apps based on key parameters such as rating, number of reviews, and number of installs.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Python** – Core language for data processing and visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For step-by-step execution and visualization
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview:
The dataset is in CSV format and contains various details of educational apps such as:
- App Name
- Rating
- Reviews
- Number of Installs
- Size
- Category

---

## 🔍 Key Features & Functionalities:

### ✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
- Removal of null and duplicate values
- Conversion of text-based numeric fields (e.g., '1,000+') to integers
- Handling missing ratings by filling or filtering them

### 📊 Analysis Performed:
- Identification of top-rated apps
- Apps with the most reviews
- Apps with the highest number of installs
- Sorting and filtering based on different metrics

### 📈 Visualizations:
- **Bar Chart**: Top apps by Rating
- **Bar Chart**: Top apps by Number of Reviews
- **Bar Chart**: Top apps by Number of Installs

### 📋 Output Summary:
- Tabular representation of cleaned and sorted data
- Graphical representation for easier interpretation

## 📌 Highlights from the Code:
- `df.dropna()` – Used to remove rows with missing values
- `df.sort_values()` – For ranking apps
- `plt.bar()` – Used for visualizing comparisons
