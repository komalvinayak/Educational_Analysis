##  Project Title:
**Educational Apps Analysis - A Python Project**

##  Objective:
To explore, clean, analyze, and visualize data of various educational apps to identify the most efficient and popular apps based on key parameters such as rating, number of reviews, and number of installs.

---

##  Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Python** ‚Äì Core language for data processing and visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äì For step-by-step execution and visualization
- **Pandas** ‚Äì Data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib** ‚Äì Data visualization

---

##  Dataset Overview:
The dataset is in CSV format and contains various details of educational apps such as:
- App Name
- Rating
- Reviews
- Number of Installs
- Category

---

##  Key Features & Functionalities:

###  Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
- Removal of null and duplicate values
- Conversion of text-based numeric fields (e.g., '1,000+') to integers
- Handling missing ratings by filling or filtering them

###  Analysis Performed:
- Identification of top-rated apps
- Apps with the most reviews
- Apps with the highest number of installs
- Sorting and filtering based on different metrics

###  Visualizations:
- **Bar Chart**: Top apps by Rating
- **Bar Chart**: Top apps by Number of Reviews
- **Bar Chart**: Top apps by Number of Installs

###  Output Summary:
- Tabular representation of cleaned and sorted data
- Graphical representation for easier interpretation

##  Highlights from the Code:
- `df.dropna()` ‚Äì Used to remove rows with missing values
- `df.sort_values()` ‚Äì For ranking apps
- `plt.bar()` ‚Äì Used for visualizing comparisons
